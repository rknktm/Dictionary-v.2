This is my first Python project in Github... 
With this project, I tried to perform addition, deletion, update and listing on these word pairs by reading the antonyms from the file. I have added the ability to add new word pairs with the adding section of the project. The word finding feature can be performed in two ways. If words have more than one opposite meaning, I tried to add new word addition, deletion and update feature to these word pairs.
I released v2.3 as the first version. then I tried to add additional features to this version and to solve a few problematic points. With v4, I made the delete feature more functional.
